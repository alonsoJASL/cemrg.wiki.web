When naming variables, functions, classes, and files, it is important to follow a naming convention, and use correct English spelling. This assists with search, find, and replace operations. Naming conventions are used to improve visual appearance and reduce the effort needed to read and understand the code. The following points are a good guide:

* Avoid abbreviation, where possible.
* All naming should be descriptive, where appropriate.
* Spaces cannot be used. Use camel case for variables starting with lowercase e.g. `totalHeight`.
* Constants are defined as all uppercase using underscores to separate words e.g. `MAX_HEIGHT`.
